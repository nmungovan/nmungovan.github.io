I'm using React/Typescript to show off what I have learned during my time on co-op (state/component management, redux, organization).
Like the work I have done on co-op as a software engineer, this is being iteratively built and tested as I go.

I've moved on from the simple HTML/CSS styling from the past and revamped my website to be more user/mobile friendly and overall just easier to digest. 
I am using the Create React app framework and React 18 to create a portfolio of the experiences/projects I have done over the years. Using TailwindCSS has allowed me to create better reusable components and conform to software development principles.

To track my progress, I am versioning each new code change and creating pull requests to showcase each addition/change and the reasoning behind my design choices.

Creating my personal website as a personal project to force myself to learn more about 
HTML/CSS/front-end development.
