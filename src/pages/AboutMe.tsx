/*
<p>Hello! I am a second-year computer science major with a concentration in Systems and a minor in Management
    Information Systems studying at Northeastern University and looking for co-operative education experiences for
    January-August 2023. I have four years of experience with Java (and about two with OOP principles), and I am
    learning other languages like Python, C++, HTML <em>(website coded entirely by me!)</em>, and Racket. I am
    rather interested in software development, cybersecurity (network/systems security), and embedded
    systems.</p>
    <p>I work as a Data Analyst for the Northeastern University College of Professional Studies Academic Quality and
    Assessment (AQA) team, where I compile, analyze, and share data on measures of academic performance in forty
    degree programs. I am working on a research project in this role to understand how different subject areas have
    leveraged the university's LMS Canvas to promote AQA along with standardization of course materials.</p>
<p>Other than academics, I am an avid cat lover, local coffee shop go-er, Trader Joe's enthusiast, and music
    fanatic. I am an informal mentor for high school students at Charlestown High School (Boston, MA) and a couple
    of CS students at Northeastern. As a first-generation, low-income student, I have had to figure out a lot of
    things on my own-- the college process, the transition to a college lifestyle, and resources available to me.
    Simply put, I feel like I already have a lot of knowledge on many college topics, and I am actively working to
    make them more accessible to everyone. I believe everyone deserves to have that knowledge.</p>
<p>I am also a volunteering committee member for Northeastern University's Council for University Programs (CUP),
    where we work as a team to plan events on campus (small concerts, comedy shows, Springfest, Homecoming
    Festival). We get a behind-the-scenes look on how the music/booking industry works, and have a lot of fun doing
    it.</p>
<p>I am a Khoury College of Computer Sciences representative for the Student Government Assocation's Academic
    Affairs committee. I have worked to pass a proposal to update content for a Management Information Systems
    course (MISM2301) at Northeastern, along with working to make the course content for another course,
    Object-Oriented Design (CS3500), more accessible to students.</p>
