    <h3>Software Projects</h3>
    <h4>Spotify Playlist Creator (In Progress)</h4>
    <p>Working with client/server authentication through Spotify's Web API and using object-oriented design in Python to create a working playlist creator 
      using SOLID principles.</p>
    <h4>Marble Solitaire</h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/nmungovan/marble-solitaire-cs3500">Link</a>
    <p>Created a fully customizable marble solitaire game in Java following object-oriented design principles. Contains options for board sizes, hole 
      placement, type (English, Triangle, European), and view type (console/GUI). Built as JAR file, the project can be executed within a Java environment.</p>
    <h4>Multiplayer JezzBall</h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/nmungovan/multiplayer-jezzball-cs2500a">Link</a>
    <p>Created an "n"-player game of JezzBall in Racket using big-bang and message handlers over a client-server network (to connect remote players) with 
      working game logic for one and multiple players.</p>
    <h4>ASL Alphabet to English Translator</h4>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZNsXIzvjVcgecxfeB7EHYy0y39tuzqn1/view?usp=sharing">Demo</p>
    <p>Created a physical prototype glove (using Adafruit M4 Metro Board and Python) that analyzes various accelerometer outputs on digits through 
      normalization/dot product comparison and outputs a letter based on those readings against a database of values (HID keyboard).</p>
    
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <h4>Northeastern University, Khoury College of Computer Sciences (Boston, MA)</h4>
    <p>Pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a current concentration in Systems along with a minor in Management Information Systems.</p>
